# C++ Modules

These C++ modules are part of the curriculum at 42 school and aim to cover various fundamental and advanced concepts in C++ programming. From 'cpp00' focusing on basic topics like namespaces and classes to 'cpp04' covering advanced concepts like subtype polymorphism, these exercises aim to strengthen skills in memory allocation, inheritance, and more. Each module contains exercises designed to be compiled using the 'make' command.

## Project Description

| Module Name | Theme |
|-------------|-------|
| cpp00       | Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuff |
| cpp01       | Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement |
| cpp02       | Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and Orthodox Canonical class form |
| cpp03       | Inheritance |
| cpp04       | Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces |

## Installation

To set up these C++ modules, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone <repo url> cpp_modules
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd cpp_modules
```

## Usage

To run an exercise:
1. Navigate to the exercise folder (e.g., `cpp00/ex00`).
2. Run `make` to generate the executable.
3. Execute the generated executable to observe the exercise output or behavior.

Each module folder (e.g., `cpp00`) contains a subject PDF file (e.g., `cpp00.pdf`) that provides detailed explanations, requirements, and guidelines for each exercise within that module.
